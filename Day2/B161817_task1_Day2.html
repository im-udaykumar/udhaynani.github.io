                    <p>In Internship(May-2021 to July-2021) with IITKGPR Under Professor M/s Bharathi Choudary,
                        I have worked with Deep Learning technology and Implemented research article. The
                        article is about counting leaves in plant images, which is visual key(phenotype)
                        describing its development and growth. It enables growth rate estimation and is related
                        to the health status of the plant and its yield.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            For this Prepared image dataset and counted leaves in each image.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The proposed method for model is multitask learning using image segmentation and
                            regression techniques using efficient nets(mobile nets)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Used transfer learning for pre-trained weights.
